### Add function

I created a function, where `a` (First number: ) and `b` (Second number: ) variables' value are defined by the user, and they will be add up in the `c` variable. The result will be printed out to the user.

To call it:
- Clone this repository
- Install Python version 3.8.7.
- Open your terminal:
    *  Create a virtual environment with the command `mkvirtualenv <environment name>` in the terminal, where you replace `<environment name>` with the name of your choice.
        + After that, you can use the command `workon <environment name>` to load that specific environment
    * Move to the `Exercise1.1` folder.
    * Enter command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the packages you need to run this function.
    * Now you can run the function with the command `ipython add.py`.
